## I was struggling when I have decided I will learn about server side Kotlin.

### I didn't find any simple sample backend code for study.

That is why I have created this one

## Goal

- Create a REST full backend server
- Create an active connection with a MySQL database
- Serve the React App's HTML and JavaScript files

## Extra information

### Before the first code running:

- Intelj idea is strongly recommended when you are new to Kotlin Development
- For the MySQL Connection, you have to define an exact package in the IDE.
- Location:File/ProjectStructure/Libaries than add the file what you can find in the MysqlConnectorFile folder.
- You have to Install the Ktor plugin through the IDE's plugin/extensions menu
- Create the SQL Database and the table, what is needed. You can find the exact query in the MysqlConnectorFile folder.
